# Design Document

## Overview
The Elder Scrolls: Ike (name pending) is a task-tracking software inspired by Habitica. Tasks are represented as quests, similarly to a Quest Log in an RPG. Quests may have attributes such as Timed (having a due date), Daily (regularly occurring on intervals), or Questline (part of a series of quests). Quests may also have a quest location or specific set rewards. 

The project is intended primarily for personal use, but if it is phenominally functional and people express interest, I may open the project to the public.

## Scenarios
Here are some potential use-case scenarios:

### Scenario 1
Ike is practicing their scales on the guitar as part of the "Learn The Major Scales" quest. This quest is in a long questline named "Learn The Guitar". Ike is working on the questline because the reward for the final quest is "Buy A New Guitar"!

### Scenario 2
Ike really wants to play The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but unfortunately, today is Thursday, a day when Zelda is normally illegal. Ike consults their Quest Log, and sees that the quest "Work An Hour On The Elder Scrolls: Ike" has the reward "Play Zelda For A Half Hour". So, Ike dutifully puts in an hour of work to enjoy a half hour of play.

### Scenario 3
Ike struggles to keep plants alive when they're not in plain sight. So, Ike adds a new Daily Quest named "Water The Damn Plants," which becomes active once a week on Tuesday, and has the reward "Eat A Cookie".

## Non-goals
- Recreate Habitica
    - Specifically, I do not intend to implement any of the other "gamified" features of Habitica, such as characters and items. I want a much simpler concept and UI.

## Object Specifications

A Quest object will have the following fields:
 - ``Long`` ID
 - ``String`` Quest Name
 - ``String`` Quest Description
 - ``Enumeration: Timed, Daily, Questline, Other`` Quest Type
 - ``Data Type?`` Location
    - String is easiest, could enumerate Home, Library, etc. or put use actual location data
 - ``List<QuestObjective>``Quest Objectives (nullable?)
 - ``String`` Quest Reward
 - ``Boolean`` Completed?
    - Alternatively, ``Enumeration: NotStarted, InProgress, Completed`` Quest Status?

 A Quest Objective object will have the following fiels:
 - ``String`` Objective Name
 - ``Boolean`` Completed?

A Questline object will have the following fields:
- ``Long`` ID
- ``String`` Questline Name
- ``List<Quest>`` Quest List
    - More likely, ``List<Long>`` Quest List (by ID)
- ``Long`` Active Quest ID
- ``Boolean`` Completed?
Functionality Note: Only Objectives in the Active Quest can be completed at a time, and only that Quest's Rewards can be received. Completing a Quest in a Questline unlocked the next Quest.

 I will also include standard repository and controller items, as well as unit tests.

## UI
- Layout similar to a quest log in a video game
    - Examples: [Skyrim](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.megabearsfan.net%2Fimage.axd%2F2015%2F11%2FSkyrim-quest_log_filler_2.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=a935a9a28a0806c4ff3305dd12a8dcbc7f2f9a66a907dd70a5e85f4729acd3f3&ipo=images), [Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Foyster.ignimgs.com%2Fmediawiki%2Fapis.ign.com%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-hd%2Fthumb%2F1%2F18%2FAdventure_Log_Screen.jpg%2F468px-Adventure_Log_Screen.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=4a082bbb04a70add3f7315e512c4e59c82a47216aad2ab7f83ded8ed4b78312a&ipo=images), [Horizon Zero Dawn](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2F4IwQX1wbQ_msEqyjQsJFjQaYZL0%3D%2F0x0%3A3840x2160%2F1200x0%2Ffilters%3Afocal(0x0%3A3840x2160)%3Ano_upscale()%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F8149467%2FHorizon_Zero_Dawn__20170309234355.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=145998de67904b155b035f72ca07d2a97f09ffad8ee241da54a83f2e3fd7ed09&ipo=images) [(Categories)](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F8034933%2F0036_HZD.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=d6e18edd7ac17330324f679cefed3c6ff448b92e1f9dc52de39b70635486cc98&ipo=images), [Kim Keiser Design Template](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kimkiserdesign.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F07%2Fquestlog.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=de5947e2ee29400e6c72f3feb1f459e2ca3d205856b8cee632008a5d6ac0e44d&ipo=images)
- Quests represented in categories, split by questline, timed, daily, like in HZD
    - OR all layed out in a list, like in Skyrim
- Option to filter based on location, sort by due date

## Beyond MVP
If opening the app to other people:
- Refactor to include ownership
- Add and configure Spring security
- Add sign-in feature to UI

The following are cool ideas that would be fun to implement if I get this working and still have a brain:
- Randomly generated rewards from a drop pool
- Quest descriptions generated in RPG style using GPT-4 API
- Create API to connect to other services and streamline quest-interaction
    - Idea is to create and complete quest objectives automatically using bluetooth-connected technology (similar to how quests are created and completed automatically in video games)
- Connect to Google Maps API to have a visual map with pinpoints of quest objectives
    - Possibly make use of [Google Maps for SNES API](https://github.com/ciciplusplus/mapnes)
